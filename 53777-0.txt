LINCOLNSHIRE.


On the north, Lincolnshire is bounded by the Humber, which separates it
from Yorkshire: the German Ocean and an arm of the sea called the Wash,
bound it on the East; on the South it abuts on Rutlandshire,
Northamptonshire and Cambridgeshire, its general form is an irregular
oblong.  It is in the Province of Canterbury, the Diocese of Lincoln, and
in the Midland Circuit.

Lincolnshire being proverbially a County of Fens, has obtained a name for
an unhealthy climate, which, however, just it may have been in some parts
in bygone times, is now by no means applicable; for the causes of the
cold, damp and aguish character, have been for many years declining: the
progress of drainage, and a more complete cultivation, have gradually
contributed to render the air more dry, and consequently more healthy.
This remark may be made relative to all districts, which become more
salubrious in proportion as they are more cultivated; and more friendly
to human life, in proportion as the means of supporting human life are
increased in productiveness.  The centre of the County and the district
of the Trent is very healthy: the air on the coast is very salubrious,
and numbers flock to it every summer in search of health and relaxation.

There are two ranges of very high land running though the greater part of
the County from North to South: that in the East may be called
mountainous and is called the Wolds; the Western range, on which stands
the County Town, is called the Cliff; more westward still is a fine
extent of rich pasture, along which the Trent passes.

Eastward of the Wolds lies also an extensive tract of fine feeding land,
which is watered by overflowing springs; on boring the substratum of
clay, fine spring water gushes up, and in most places will rise ten feet
above the surface, if confined in a tube: these cheap artificial springs
are general, and many hundreds are continually running, contributing
greatly to the fertility and value of the land.

The fens form the most prominent feature of the County: where fully
cultivated and completely drained their produce is incredible; but it is
a subject of great regret, that no general system of drainage, including
every district which can be made to communicant with the sea, has yet
been effected: nothing short of one uniform and connected plan can be of
full avail: and so many apparently rival interests are at stake, and so
little real public spirit exists, notwithstanding that it is so much
boasted of, that such an universal plan is more to be wished for than
hoped for.

The soil of Lincolnshire is so various as to include all sorts of land
that are to be found in the whole kingdom, and its management varies
accordingly.

Rabbits have always been an article of great consideration and attention
in the light soils of this County, and immense warrens are kept for the
purpose of supplying London with the skins; this was once as profitable a
stock as could be attended to; but latterly many warrens have been laid
down to other put poses.

It is impossible to speak too highly of the cottage system of this
county.  Round Folkingham and other places, when inclosures took place,
during the late war, by the acts of parliament, at least three acres of
land were assigned to every cottage; this, of course includes a garden
and keep for a cow: thus land, gardens, cows and pigs, are within reach
of the labouring classes.  On views of humanity and benevolence only it
is gratifying to the considerate breast to see in comfortable
circumstances that class of people on which all other classes depend.

PROVERBS.


             Few men takes his ADVICE who talks a great deal.

And no wonder: for “he who knows but little, presently outs with it.”
And, though silence is not necessarily, not in itself a proof of good
judgment, excessive talkativeness shows a want of it.  The following is
an old Grecian adage, translated:—“Tongue! whither goest thou?  To build
a city and then to destroy it!” signifying, says Erasmus, that the tongue
affords great blessings to mankind, and that the same member becomes a
cause of dreadful mischief!  Our English poet, George Wither, who wrote
in 1634, observes in his emblems,

    No heart can think to what strange ends,
    The tongue’s unruly motion tends.

            In vain does he ask ADVICE who will not follow it.

“Few things,” says Dr. Johnson, “are so liberally bestowed, or squandered
with so little effect, as good advice!”

                         Well BEGUN is half done.

This ancient proverb is found in Horace; and there is one in Italian like
it.  The BEGINNING only is hard and costs dear.

We often have great reluctance in setting about an appointed task, the
apparent difficulty continuing to increase with delay; but once engaged
in it, we proceed with pleasure until it is completed.  It is the case in
those “trifles which make the sum of human beings.”  The young scholar
wants courage to set about his lesson in time; the friend, or man of
business, to answer a letter or acquire some point of useful information:
and to go higher in the application of the maxim, it tells us, that to
begin to do good leads on to continued improvement.  So the Italians say,
BEGIN _your web_, _and God will supply you with thread_!  Akin to this,
are two valuable proverbs, which chide us for indecision and needless
hesitation, _Procrastination is the thief of time_: and

    _To do what’s right make no delay_,
    _For life and time slide fast away_.

                    Birds of a feather flock together.

Persons of similar manners are fond of associating together; but the bad
particularly: indeed, when their characters are known, they cannot easily
get other companions.  Hence it is a saying,—

    _Tell me with whom thou goest_,
    _And I will tell thou what thou doest_!

_These who sleep with dogs rise up with fleas_.  _It is bad company that
brings men to the gallows_.  Burckhardt in his collection of Arabic
proverbs, gives the following remarkable one:—_He who introduces himself
between the onion and the peel_, _goes not forth without its strong
smell_.  But on the other hand we have in the Spanish, _Associate with
the_ GOOD, _and thou shall be esteemed one of them_.

One Bird in the Hand is worth two in the Bush; and the Italians say,
Better have an egg to-day than an hen to-morrow.  But this carries the
idea too far.  Ray, quotes another, which is much better.—

    _He that leaves certainty_, _and sticks to chance_,
    _When fools pipe_, _he may dance_.

This adage, like the fable of the dog and the shadow, advises us not to
part with what we actually possess, on the distant prospect of some
doubtful or uncertain profit.  It seems a kind of madness in any one who
has a competence, or is exercising with fair success any business or
profession, to hazard all in pursuit of some new scheme, which, however
promising in appearance, may fail and involve him in ruin.  And yet how
many are the victims of this!  How many instances in our own country do
the records of the year 1825 supply.




_London Post-Office_.


THE ordinary business of each day is, in letters in the inland office
alone, 35,000 letters received, and 40,000 sent (23,475,000 annually);
exclusive of the numbers in the foreign office department and the
ship-letter office, and altogether independent of the two-penny post.
The number of newspapers daily varies from 25,000 to 60,000 (on Saturday
40,000, and on Monday 50,000), of which number about 20,000 an put into
the office ten minutes before six o’clock.  After that hour each
newspaper is charged one half-penny, which yields a revenue of fully
£1,000 a year, and of which 240,000 newspapers are annually put into the
office from six to a quarter before eight o’clock.  The revenue derived
from charges for early delivery in London is £4 000, and the sum obtained
by the charges of _one penny_ on each letter given to the postmen, who go
round with bells to collect the letters, is £3,000 a year, giving
720,000, or pearls 2,000 daily.  The revenue of London is 6,000 a week,
above £300,000 a year; and yet of all this vast annual revenue there has
only been lost by defaulters £200 in twenty-five years.  The franks
amount in a morning to 4,000 or 5,000, or more.  Newspapers can only be
franked for foreign parts to the first port at which the mail arrives;
after this they are charged postage according to their weight, in
consequence of which an English daily paper costs in St. Petersburgh £40
sterling per annum.




FLATTERY AND FRIENDSHIP.

Every one that flatters thee        But if fortune once do frown,
Is no friend in misery.             Then farewell his great renown:
Words are easy, like the wind,      They that fawned on him before,
Faithful friends are hard to        Use his company no more.
find.                               He that is thy friend indeed,
Every man will be thy friend        He will help thee in thy need.
While thou hast wherewith to        If thou sorrow, he will weep;
spend                               If thou wake he cannot sleep.
But if store of crowns be scant,    Thus of every grief in heart,
No man will supply thy want.        He with thee doth bear a part.
If that one be prodigal,            These are certain signs to know
Bountiful they will him call.       Faithful friend from flattering
If he be addict to vice,            foe.
Quickly him they will entice.

VARIOUS


Cure for Drunkenness.—A man in Maryland, notoriously addicted to this
vice, hearing an uproar in his kitchen one evening, had the curiosity to
stop without noise to the door, to know what was the matter, when he
beheld his servants indulging in the most unbounded roar of laughter at a
couple of his negro boys who were mimicking himself in his drunken fits;
showing how he reeled and staggered,—how he looked and nodded, and
hiccupped and tumbled.  The picture which these children of nature drew
of him, and which had filled the rest with so much merriment, struck him
so forcibly, that he became a perfect sober man, to the unspeakable joy
of his wife and children.

Mr. Locke was asked how he contrived to accumulate a mine of knowledge so
rich, yet so extensive and deep.  He replied, that he attributed what
little he knew, to the not having been ashamed to ask for information;
and to the rule he had laid down, of conversing with all descriptions of
men, on those topics chiefly that formed their own peculiar professions
or pursuits.

Punctuality.—Mr. Scott of Exeter, travelled on business till about 80
years of age.  He was one of the most celebrated characters in the
kingdom for punctuality, and by his methodical conduct, joined to uniform
diligence, he gradually amassed a large fortune.  For a long series of
years, the proprietors of every inn he frequented in Devon and Cornwall,
knew the very day and hour he would arrive.  A short time before he died,
a gentleman on a journey in Cornwall stopped at a small inn at Port Isaac
to dine.  The waiter presented him with a bill of fare, which he did not
approve of, but observing a fine duck roasting.  “I’ll have that,” said
the traveller.  “You cannot sir,” said the landlord, “it is for Mr. Scott
of Exeter.”  “I know Mr. Scott of Exeter very well,” rejoined the
gentlemen, “he is not in your house.”  “True,” replied the landlord,
“_but six months ago_, _when he was here last_, _he ordered a duck_ to be
ready for him this day, precisely at two o’clock;” and to the
astonishment of the traveller, he saw the old gentleman jogging into the
inn-yard about five minutes before the appointed time.

Advantages of Activity.—As animal power is exhausted exactly in
proportion to the time during which it is acting, as well as in
proportion to the intensity of force exerted, there may often be a great
saving of it by doing work quickly, although with a little more exertion
during the time.  Suppose two men of equal weight to ascend the same
stair, one of whom takes only a minute to reach the top, and the other
takes four minutes, it will cost the first little more than a fourth part
of the fatigue which it costs the second, because the exhaustion is in
proportion to the time during which the muscles are acting.  The quick
mover may have exerted perhaps one-twentieth more force in the first
instant to give his body the greater velocity, which was afterwards
continued, but the slow supported his load four times as long.

Capability greater than Performance.—Men are often capable of greater
things than they perform.  They are sent into the world with bills of
credit, and seldom draw to their full extent.




CHAPPED LIPS.


The readiest method to cure simple chaps is to wash them with barley
water, and apply the following mixture of prepared tutty and olive oil,
of each equal parts.




CHAPPED HANDS.


Rough and course hands are very unhandsome; the following compound will
always preserve them smooth: mix 4 oz. of fresh hog’s lard that has been
well washed in common water with the yolks of 2 new laid eggs, and a
large spoonful of honey; add as much fine oat-meal as to work the whole
into paste.




TO REMOVE HAIR FROM THE CHIN.


Women of sanguine complexion and habit have frequently hair growing on
their chin, which is very unseemly.  To extirpate this, use dulcified
spirit of salt on the part, and rub it gently with a linen cloth; this
will effectually kill the roots of the hair, and at the end of a week
they wither, and fall away.




RESTORATIVE POWDER FOR THE TEETH.


Acids of every denomination are unfriendly to the teeth; and by frequent
use will destroy the enamel; the following mixture not only whitens, but
tends to preserve them.  Take Peruvian bark, 2 oz. charcoal, half an oz.
Armenian bole, 1 oz. mix them altogether in a mortar.  If the teeth are
washed, take a piece of wood like a butcher’s skewer, made soft at the
end, cover it with linen, dip it them in the above ponder, and apply it
to the decayed part.




A COSMETIC TO PRODUCE A FAIR NECK AND BOSOM.


Equal parts of camomile water and white wine, as warm as can be borne,
this for a few weeks will make a considerable change in the akin.




OFFENSIVE BREATH.


A constant attendant upon the scurvy of the gums, and putrefied matter
lodged in the hollow teeth; the following gargle stands in high esteem.
Take 2 oz. of cinnamon, 6 drams of cloves, 6 oz. of Florentine orris
root, nutmeg and mace: bruise them and macerate them in a quart of
spirits of wine or French brandy, during 48 hours; when used, let it be
diluted with water.

Or, chew at night a small piece of gum myrrh; or chew night and morning a
clove, or a piece of orris root, about the size of a bean; or rub the
teeth with a piece of rag dipped in the spirits of vinegar.




TO SWEETEN MEAT, FISH, &c. THAT IS TAINTED.


When meat, fish, &c., from intense heat, or long keeping, are likely to
pass into a state of corruption, a simple and pure mode of keeping them
sound and healthful is by putting a few pieces of charcoal, each about
the size of an egg, into a pot or saucepan wherein the meat or fish is to
be boiled.  Among others, an experiment of this kind was tried on a
turbot, which appeared to be too far gone to be eatable; the cook, as
advised, put four pieces of charcoal under the strainer of the fish
kettle; after boiling the proper time, the turbot came to the table sweet
and firm.




USEFUL RECEIPTS.


OF THE SKIN.


DEFORMITIES as of the skin are generally the consequences of a
distempered blood thrown upon it.  Promoting the ordinary discharges, and
rectifying the skin by proper washes, is the only way to get rid of such
disorders.  When, therefore, any lotion is employed on the skin, the
person must always take care that some other emunctuary may be in
readiness, to discharge what to lessened by the application of the
external medicine.  Diuretics are allowed by all to be the best
auxiliaries to cosmetics, and it is hardly safe to use one without the
other.  We will first notice



OF PIMPLES.


This deformity consists in a redness of the face, attended with
inflammatory pustules, the causes of which are commonly attributed to an
acrid, thick blood, that swells and corrodes the small vessels; to clear
which, the mass of blood must be sweetened and diluted with proper
medicines.

For this purpose, infuse 4 oz. of mustard seed in a quart of while wine,
and after 3 or 4 days, drink a wine glass full of it every morning
filling up the phial as long as the seed gives any strength.—Or boil 3
spoonsful of mustard seed in a quart of milk, take off the curd, and keep
the whey for use.  This remedy is an excellent diuretic, and a cordial
for the nerves, but it differs from the first in quality.  Take half a
wine glass full every morning.

Among all the lotions, and the best to use with the above diuretic, is a
pimpernel water, which is so sovereign a beautifier of the complexion as
to deserve a place on every lady’s toilet.  It is prepared by only
infusing half a handful of this herb in a quart of water, letting it
stand all night.  It may be used a little warm, but not hot.  If not
sufficiently powerful to remove the pimples, take camphor rubbed fine in
a mortar, put upon it, a little at a time, 1 ounce of the juice of
lemons, when dissolved, add 1 pint of white wine.  This is a very good
lotion for spots and flushings: it may be used with the greatest safety.



TO TAKE IRON MOULDS OR RUSTS OUT OF LINEN.


Dissolve the powder of burnt alum in the juice of lemon: wet the place
with it, and dry it with the back of a spoon, in the fore part of which
put a live coal; and in doing it 5 or 6 times, the iron moulds will be
washed out.



TO CLEAN GOLD AND RESTORE ITS LUSTRE.


Dissolve a little sal-ammoniac in urine: boil your soiled gold therein,
and it will become clean and brilliant.



HOW TO TAKE SPOTS OR STAINS OUT OF SILK OR VELVET.


Take sopwort (a herb of that name), bruise it, and strain out the juice;
add a little black soap, and mix them well to a moderate thickness; rub
it over the stained or spotted place; warm it gradually before the fire,
and the stains will rub out with the hand.



TO RESTORE THE VOICE AND REMOVE HOARSENESS.


Many causes may contribute to this defect, particularly severe colds,
breathing an air too full of dust, &c., too much speaking or singing, or
being too much exposed to the air, on quitting convivial meetings and
other entertainments of jollity.

To remove this defect, drink freely of barley and liquorice water, eat
black currant jelly, and gargle the mouth twice or thrice every morning
with the syrup of hedge mustard, diluted in a glass of milk or warm
water.

It is certainly very mortifying to a lady to have a masculine voice, and
yet it is a very frequent circumstance.  As a means of contracting the
larynx, the extra wideness of which is the cause, you must drink nothing
hot; frequently drink lemonade, water acidulated with verjuice, oranges,
&c., and gargle the throat every morning with equal parts of verjuice and
water.



GARGLE FOR A SORE THROAT.


Take a handful of red sage leaves, simmer them 2 minutes in a third of a
pint of water, strain the liquor off; when cold add an equal quantity of
vinegar, and sweeten it with honey.  These receipts are best for general
purposes, and may be used with perfect safety, and generally with the
happiest effect.



FOR A COUGH.


Mix vinegar and treacle in equal quantities, let a teaspoonful be taken
occasionally, when the cough is troublesome.  This is a receipt of the
excellent Dr. James, of Carlisle.



FOR CLEANING IRON AND BRASS.


Half an oz. of cream of tarter, half a dram of cochineal, quarter pound
of sulphuric acid.  The above mixed with a quart of water, and when
wanted to use, mix a little Bath brick with the liquid, to the
consistency of paste; and apply it to the iron or brass with wash
leather.



FOR DESTROYING RATS AND MICE.


Get a sixpenny packet of Winton’s Compound Mixture, (it may be had of any
medicine vender), and mix it with a little butter or lard, and scatter it
where the vermin resort.  Whole parishes have been entirely cleared of
them by the above, when it has been generally used.



CORNS.


This plaster will always give relief, and frequently remove them: 1 oz.
of Venice turpentine, the yolks of 2 eggs, 2 drams of mercurial plaster,
half an oz. of yellow wax; the turpentine and wax must be melted
together; mix the other ingredients when fluid.  Or, take equal
quantities of roasted onion and soft water, beat them together, and apply
them as a poultice.  This application will instantly appease the pain of
the corn.



TO MAKE CHEAP BLACKING.


Take 4 oz. of ivory black, 3 oz. of the coarsest moist sugar, a table
spoonful of sweet oil, and a pint of small beer, with half a spoonful of
the oil of vitrol; mix them gradually, cold.



HEAD ACHE.


Ceplinile snuff in a general way remove the afflicting pain of the head
ache.  One scruple of turpeth mineral, half a dram of powdered ginger, 1
scruple of powdered nutmeg, 3 drops of oil of rosemary, well mixed, and
snuffed up the nose.



CURE FOR WEAK EYES.


Take a lump of white copperas about the size of a pea, put it in a small
phial that contains about 2 ounces of water, carry this in the pocket,
and occasionally taking out the cork, turn the phial on the finger’s end,
and thus bathe the eyes.  This will positively effect a cure in a short
time.



INFLAMED EYES.


Is a very painful and well-known complaint, arising sometimes from cold,
and frequently from a very acrid blood which stimulates the delicate
vessels of the eye, swelling and inflaming them.  The following eye
waters are very good to cool sharp, hot humours, they may be readily
prepared, and will more effectually answer their end if assisted by the
use of diuretics at the same time.  First, calaminaris levigated, half a
dram, rose water, 2 oz.—Second, take white vitrol, 15 grains, rose water,
2 oz.—With either of these, the eyes may be washed at discretion, in all
hot defluctions; but when the sight decays from dryness, or a defect in
the optic nerve, such things can avail but little.—When a poultice is
necessary, you may take half a pint of the decoction of linseed, and as
much flour of linseed as is sufficient to make it a proper consistency.
This poultice is preferable to bread and milk for sore eyes, it will not
grow sour nor acid.  In corroboration of the above, we give a letter to
the editor of the Mechanics’ Magazine, page 95, vol. I.

    “Sir,—Reading your miscellany to a friend, a cure for weak eyes, he
    had recourse to your receipt, and was cured in a short time, though
    he had previously spent much money without getting relief from the
    faculty.  I hope your readers who may be in a similar situation, will
    follow the example.”



OINTMENT FOR BURNS.


This ointment has never yet failed to give relief; yellow basilicon 3
ounces turpentine 1½ ounce.



FOR SHORTNESS OF BREATH.


Mix ¾ of an oz. of fine powdered senna, ½ an oz. of the flour of
brimstone, ¼ of an oz. of powdered ginger, in 4 oz. of clarified honey.
Take about the size of a nutmeg every night and morning for five
successive days, afterwards, once a week for some time, and finally once
a fortnight.



TO MAKE GINGER BEER.


One ounce and a half of well-bruised ginger, 1 ounce of cream of tartar,
1 sliced lemon, 1 pound of white sugar.  Put these ingredients into an
earthen vessel, and pour upon them a gallon of water, boiling; when cold,
add a table spoonful of yeast, and let the whole stand till next morning;
then skim and bottle it; keep it three days in a cool place it will then
be fit for use.




PROBLEMS.


A country woman carrying eggs to a garrison, where she had three guards
to pass, sold at the first half the number she had, and half an egg more;
at the second, the half of what remained, and half an egg more; and at
the third, the half of the remainder and half an egg more; when she
arrived at the market-place, she had three dozen still to sell, how was
this possible, without breaking any of the eggs?

_Solution_.—The possibility of this problem will be evident when it is
considered, that by taking the greater half of an odd number, we take the
exact half—½.  It will he found therefore, that the woman, before she
passed the last guard, had 73 eggs remaining, for by selling 37 of them
at that guard which is the half—½, she would have 36 remaining.  In the
like manner, before she came to the second guards she had 147; and before
she came to the first, 295.

Two Greeks dicing together, one provided five dishes, the other three.  A
stranger happened to pop in, and requested to join them.  On his
departure, he gave the Greek who had provided five dishes _five_
shillings, and to the other who had furnished three dishes, _three_
shillings; but the latter was dissatisfied, and had the matter referred
to Solon, who instantly decided that the Greek who had provided five
dishes should have _seven_ shillings, and he who furnished the three
dishes should receive but _one_ shilling.

_Solution_.—Each Greek paid eight shillings, which are twenty-four
shillings for eight dishes, or three shillings per dish.  The one who
provided five being fifteen shillings out of pocket, had a right to have
seven shillings refunded to him, which left him eight shillings, his
proportion.

   When first the marriage knot was tied, betwixt my love and me,
   My age did then her’s exceed us three times three doth three.
   But when we ten and half ten years we man and wife had been,
   Her age came up as near to mine, as eight is to sixteen.

Solution.—The man was 45, the woman was 15.

HINTS TO THOSE
WHO ASK,
WHY SHOULD I CONTRIBUTE TO SUPPORT MISSIONS TO
THE HEATHEN?


WHAT ARE THE OBJECTS OF SUCH MISSIONS?  Are they not to make known the
glorious Gospel of the blessed God; to institute Christian Schools; to
erect places of Christian worship; to collect Christian societies; and
thus to banish Pagan ignorance, Pagan vices, and Pagan cruelties, from
the earth?

HAVE NOT SUCH OBJECTS BEEN ALREADY ACCOMPLISHED, TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, IN
VARIOUS PARTS OF THE HEATHEN WORLD?—This is indisputable.  Many in Asia,
Africa, America, Australasia, and Polynesia, no longer worship idols; no
longer destroy each other.  Many mothers no more cast their children to
the crocodiles, or drown them in rivers.  Many aged and sick persons, who
would have been cast out into the woods in age and infirmity, are now
cherished by their children.  Many thousands of children, in the
different Mission Schools in India, Africa, the South-Sea inlands, and
other places, are now reading the word of God, worshipping our Saviour,
and singing his praises; who would otherwise have been trained up in
idolatry, and all its polluting and degrading superstitions.  Many adults
have been brought to the knowledge of Christ; and many have died in peace
and in the hope of heaven, whose sun would otherwise have set amid the
dark and lowering clouds of Heathenism.  Finally, the work, though in
some places feeble, has been begun; it is spreading its enlightening and
sanctifying influence among surrounding millions; and it exhibits to our
faith and hope the dawn of the universal salvation.

ARE YOU A MAN?—Do you not then shudder at the miseries, and oppressions,
and murders, which Heathenism is daily practising, and which Christianity
brings to an end wherever it prevails?  On the principle of common
humanity and sympathy, you will then surely feel an interest in Missions,
nor suffer the cry of slaughtered widows and children, and the voice of
distress, pouring out its wailings from all lands, to reach your ears in
vain.

ARE YOU A BRITON?  Think of the vastness of the British Empire,
comprising, at a low calculation, upwards of a HUNDRED MILLIONS of
subjects, most of whom are Pagan idolaters.  Why has Providence given us
power, but to employ it so that, wherever it is felt, “mankind may feel
our mercy too?”  Shall we enjoy the advantages of that extensive commerce
which so vast an empire gives to us; shall we revel in the luxuries of
the West and of the East; shall we turn every colony to gain? and shall
we neglect the souls of our fellow-subject?  If we do so, we cannot be
guiltless before Him who governs the world, and who will bless our
blessings, or wither them, as we are faithful or unfaithful to the
behests of His Providence.  As a Briton, therefore, you are bound to
support Missions, and by them to fill the whole empire with the blessings
of that Christianity we enjoy at home.

DO YOU PROFESS TO BE A TRUE AND LIVELY CHRISTIAN?—Then you love your
Saviour, and must desire that all should love and worship Him.  Then you
pray daily, “Thy kingdom come,” and must mean something when you thus
pray, or you offer vain service, and mock God.  Then you pity the
ignorant, and weep over perishing souls; and, if so, you must, you will,
do all you can to point them to “the Lamb of God, which taketh away the
sin of the world.”

ARE YOU A CHRISTIAN PARENT?—You look with joy and gratitude upon your
rising family.  You placed them, by holy baptism, in the arms of Jesus,
that He might bless them.  They are in covenant with Him.  They hearken
unto you, and you teach them the fear of the Lord.  You send them into
life, commended to God as their “sun and shield.”  You rejoice in the
hope of meeting them all again in the kingdom of Heaven.  O happy
Christian parent!  O favoured Christian families!—families “whom Jesus
loves.”  But Missions are creating many such families among Negroes,
Hottentots, Fejees, New Zealanders, the Friendly Islanders, the American
Indians, and the Singalese.  Many a Heathen hut resounds with praise; and
parents and children, once idolaters, bow before the throne of grace in
united family worship.  Do not you rejoice in this? and will you not do
your utmost to promote the cause of Christ, till all the families of the
earth, like your own, are blessed in Him?

ARE YOU A CHRISTIAN CHILD?—What do you owe to Christ, whose adorable name
you bear!  But for the blessed Gospel, you had scarcely known your
parents’ tender love.  No prayers to the true God would have been offered
by them on your behalf.  You would have been a worshipper of the ugly,
gloomy gods of Paganism.  You might have been cast into a river, or
turned out to perish in a wood; or, if not, you would have grown up in
ignorance, vice, and misery.  You would have had no education; never have
read the blessed Bible; never have sung a hymn of praise to God, and
would not have had, as now, the prospect of a happy, useful life, and a
glorious heaven.  O what do you owe to Christ!  You feel that you ought
to love Him, and how can you better show that you do love Him, than by
pitying poor, ignorant Heathen children, and contributing some little of
your spare money, to send them Ministers, to build them Schools, to buy
them the Bible and holy books, and teach them all the blessed truths
which you have learned of Christ, the Saviour of the world?

HAVE YOU LATELY BEEN MADE YOURSELF A PARTAKER OF THE GRACE OF CHRIST?—How
much do you owe to Him who hath brought you “out of a horrible pit, and
out of the miry clay;” and how ought you to pity all who are living
“without hope and without God in the world!”  When you felt the burden of
sin, you heard of Christ, and his willingness to save.

    “Dying, you heard the welcome sound,
    And pardon in his mercy found.”

But millions of the poor Heathen feel that burden too, yet they know not
where to fly for relief; they go from idol to idol; from sacrifice to
sacrifice; perform painful pilgrimages, and torture their bodies.  But in
vain! the sting remains; the fear of the future still pursues them.  Do
they not cry, even in your ears, “Men and brethren, what shall we do?”
and will not you, remembering the sweetness of that hour when you
obtained mercy by believing in Christ, make haste to tell them, by the
Missionaries you send forth, where pardon may be found?  O you not, by
your liberalities, cause these blessed words to be sounded in the ears of
all such mourning, broken spirits?—

    “Sinners, believe the gospel word:
       Jesus is come your souls to save!
    Jesus is come, your common Lord;
       Pardon ye all through him may have;
    May now be saved, whoever will:
    This man receiveth sinners still.”

FINALLY, ARE YOU AN AGED CHRISTIAN?—How often have you prayed, “O Lord,
revive thy work!”  How often have you longed to see the dawn of the day
of Christ upon all nations!  Well, now you see it.  God has granted you
this before you depart to be with Christ.  You, you aged servant of God,
must rejoice in it.  Your long life of mercy has been crowned with this
mercy.  Tell all about you, how you “saw the cloud arise, little as a
human hand;” bid them look to its spreading showers; mark its reviving
influence; and hear the “sound of abundance of rain.”  Yes, you will
encourage our youth to pledge themselves to this cause; you will give it
the sanction and aid of your counsel and influence; and you will die in
greater peace and higher triumph, since “your eyes have seen His
salvation; a light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of his people
Israel.”

“Let the children of Zion,” therefore, “be joyful in their King.”  “Both
young men and maidens, old men and children, let them praise the Lord,”
and unite to proclaim “His glory among the Heathen, His wonders among all
people,” till the whole earth shall be filled with the honours of His
high and glorious name.  Amen.

But do any of you ask, WHAT CAN I DO IN THIS CAUSE?—This is an important
and serious question, especially when you consider that that day will
come when you must “give up your stewardship, and be no longer steward”
of your Lord’s goods, whether he has entrusted you with five, three, or
only one talent; and when he will doubtless ask you, what you have done
to promote His cause in the world.

Well, then, it may be kindly and affectionately inquired of you, whether
you do not indulge in some needless superfluities of meat, drink,
apparel, furniture, or show, which, even in perfect consistency with your
rank of life, whatever it may be, you may reduce, and have more to spend
in works of piety and charity at home and abroad?  Put this question to
your hearts in the fear of God.

If you have no obvious superfluities, yet may not your economy, that is,
your management of what you have, be more exact, methodical, and careful?
So that even your own affairs will be more prosperous; and, from this
good management, you may find much more to give to these great services
than even now you are yourselves aware of.  Try the experiment; for many
have tried it, and have found themselves enabled to become “rich in good
works,” almost without cost to themselves.

Ask, What cannot I give?  Cannot I spare this penny every week?—Why not?
Cannot I give this shilling, as a monthly subscription; or this pound, or
even several pounds, as a yearly one?  Why not?  You may have an answer,
but see that it is a good one; that it is such an one as you can with
confidence give to your Lord, when He calls you to give an account of
your stewardship.

Cannot I give my influence to this cause?  Why not?  I have some
influence, perhaps as a master, or as a parent, or as a neighbour, or as
a friend.  Cannot I employ this talent of influence in inducing servants,
children, neighbours, friends, to take a share in all the good which the
Lord is doing upon earth among the children of men?  Will they not be
benefited by it?  How many good thoughts will it put into their minds!
How probable is it, that they may feel more sensibly the value of the
Gospel than before, by considering the situation of those nations who
have it not!  How much will it enlarge their knowledge, to place before
them the publications of a Missionary Society!  How much will it ennoble
the heart of the poorest and youngest among them, to teach them to live
to benefit all mankind!  Cannot I take even an active part in this work,
if called upon; or may I not humbly offer my services in some department?
Why not?  Collectors, patient, persevering Collectors, are always
wanting; and why cannot I become a Collector, and have the honour and
blessedness of begging for a perishing world?  Treasurers, Secretaries,
Members of Committees, are wanting wherever a Missionary Society is
formed, who will be active in their duty, and constant in their
attendance.  Cannot I then, if called upon, take my share of any of those
duties, whenever they are assigned me?  Why not?  What good and serious
reason can I give against it, when, laying my hand upon my heart, I ask,
“How much owest thou unto my Lord?”  Cannot I converse on these great
subjects, and arouse my own languid zeal, and that of others, by this
means?  Why not?  Would not this shut out many trifling things from
conversation; and will not the constant reading of Missionary
Publications, and accounts of the progress of Christ’s kingdom in the
world, furnish conversation with some of the best and most inspiring
topics?—and is not this in character, when, as the Psalmist says, “All
thy works shall praise Thee, O Lord, and thy saints shall bless thee;
they shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power, to
make known to the sons of men His mighty acts, and the glorious majesty
of His kingdom.”  And cannot I join my prayers, prayers in my closet, in
my family, and in the Church of God: thus acknowledging that the work is
the Lord’s, and that vain is the help of man,—thus bringing upon all
counsel, and upon all effort, the prospering blessing of Him who “worketh
all and in all?”  Rest not till you have put to yourself all these
questions, and then so act as “the answer of a good conscience” shall
direct.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
